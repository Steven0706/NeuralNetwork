# Neural Network
Neural  Network with backpropagation.
Implement a feed-forward neural network for classifying handwritten digits. 
Back propagation to compute the parameter derivatives for SGD and also do L2 regularization for SGD. tinyTOY.pkl.gz, MNIST(tinyMNIST.pkl.gz).

# Convolution Nueral Networks
Conv2D layer in Keras to build a Convolutional Neural Network for the MNIST dataset.
reshape the vector of each image into matrix for the use of Conv2D.
